/* Sleep (2026-09-14, revised the same day after Strato found a quick
 * sleep/wake "feels like a soft boot"): two stages.
 *  1. GRACE, 20 min (was 90 s until 2026-09-16 evening): save, panel and touch off, IMU quiesced, then RAM-alive
 *     LIGHT sleep with BOOT (GPIO, level low) and a timer armed. A press in
 *     this window resumes IN PLACE - the fish exactly where they were,
 *     mid-goal - after crediting the nap to tank_tick_sleep. Costs what the
 *     old drowse did (~4.7 mA), for 20 min at most - ~1.6 mAh per sleep.
 *     Why 20 min and not 90 s: from the PMIC power-off only a PWRON hold
 *     longer than ONLEVEL (128 ms, the shortest the AXP2101 offers) boots
 *     the board; a lighter tap does nothing at all (Strato's presses time
 *     at ~150 ms on the PMIC's own clock - director `keytime`). Inside the
 *     grace the chip is awake and any tap wakes it, so the short absences
 *     stay a tap and only a real absence ends in the power-off.
 *  2. DEEP sleep once the grace passes: BOOT armed as ext0, chip down to
 *     microamps, RAM and PSRAM gone. Waking is a boot: app_main sees the
 *     ext0 (or the director's timer) wake cause and calls progression_wake -
 *     restore the save, then ONE tank_tick_sleep for the real time since it
 *     was written (the grace included; nothing ticked during it) - and then
 *     puts every fish back where it fell asleep, on the goal it had, from a
 *     snapshot kept in RTC slow memory (survives deep sleep, not power-off:
 *     after a cold boot the fish may scatter, and that is fine).
 *  Since 2026-09-16 (the night the cell died; Strato: one key, no modes to
 *  remember, "an extended sleep is exactly that, night or noon"): stage 2 is
 *  the AXP2101 soft POWER-OFF - < 40 uA with the RTC clock alive - and the
 *  PWR key (or USB) boots the tank, where progression_boot lives the whole
 *  stretch through. Deep sleep is now only the director's timed measurement
 *  window and the no-PMIC fallback; there the digital pads are HELD (the
 *  I2S + amp lines driven low, gpio_deep_sleep_hold_en), which is also what
 *  makes esp-idf isolate every other digital pad: un-isolated, deep sleep
 *  drew ~15 mA by the batlog, three times the light-sleep drowse it replaced. */
