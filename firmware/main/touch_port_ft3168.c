/* touch_port_ft3168.c — FT3168 capacitive touch (FT5x06 register family) ->
 * tank_touch_hold / tank_touch_tap, with the same gesture timing as the sim's
 * mouse: press+release < 350 ms with < 24 px displacement = tap (fingertips
 * roll and this panel is 322 ppi); held > 300 ms = hold; a drag down from
 * the top edge = feed at that x; every touched frame streams to
 * tank_touch_drag (a moving stroke wipes algae; a horizontal slash through
 * a canopy trims it). Fish taps hit-test 38 px against the press-time fish
 * snapshot AND the current position - fish move during a tap. While the stats
 * card is up, a tap anywhere on empty glass dismisses it (hunting the same
 * fish again to close it was the old, cumbersome way) and does nothing else.
 * While the battery pill shows (main.c says so each frame), a tap on it -
 * RENDER_BAT_HIT, the pill plus a fingertip's slop - opens the battery page;
 * any release closes that page (2026-09-24).
 * Coordinates are mapped from the portrait panel to the landscape tank.
 * The ROUND board (1.75C, 2026-10-01) has a CST9217 instead, read here
 * directly over I2C; its panel px go through the display port's view
 * (display_port_panel_to_tank) and everything after that is the same.
 * The WATCH (2.06, 2026-10-02) has the FT3168 of the 1.8's V1 board, its
 * reset on a GPIO. Its own build is a portrait tank: panel px = tank px. */

 * slightly left", "fingers land low near the bezel". Inverted: the same map
 * on the mirrored raw values (the panel's geometry does not turn with the

 *   target x  110  233  356      reported  107  231  357   (sd 8..13 px a column)

 * low. In x the fit (1.015 x - 4.8, the gain +/- 0.013) cannot be told from
 * the taps' own scatter - a fingertip lands within a millimeter, 10 px on
 * this glass - so x is left as the panel says.
 *
 * The watch (FT3168), 2026-10-01: 45 presses on its 3 x 3, WORN on the
 * wrist and tapped with the other hand's finger (two sittings), the bias
 * inside:
 *

 *   target y   70  251  432      reported   79  257  425
 *
 * reported = 0.963 x + 14.8 and 0.957 y + 13.5: this panel reads SMALL (4%),
 * where the other two read large, and worn the finger lands right of and
 * below the cross at the top left of the glass. A first sitting of 27, the
 * watch held in the hand and tapped with its thumb, sat 10 px left of these
 * (0.974 x + 5.7, 0.975 y + 14.7): the grip moves where a finger lands by

 * 29..420 and y 11..333 - a finger on the outer 29 px (the bottom 35) reads
 * as the limit, never beyond. Taps want exactly that map (the crosshairs),
 * but a scrub could no longer reach the film in the edge cells and a slash
 * stopped short of a bed's outer frond and of the floor (Strato: "difficult
 * if not impossible to scrub algae which sits too close to the glass edge",
 * "the farthest left and most far right seagrass fronds cannot be clipped").
 * Before the calibration the stretched report overshot to the edge on its
 * own. So the stream to tank_touch_drag - and nothing else - is stretched
 * over the last EDGE_BAND_* px inside each limit so the limit lands on the
 * glass (EDGE_SNAP_* short of it already does: a pad at the bezel does not
 * drive the report to its very end). A stroke keeps the finger's own
 * travel for its first EDGE_RAMP0_PX and eases into the full stretch by
 * EDGE_RAMP1_PX: a tap's roll is not magnified into a wipe or a snip (tank.c
 * WIPE_ENGAGE_PX / SLASH_PX), a real stroke runs to the glass. It LANDS
 * fully stretched in y (a sweep along the floor is on the floor from its
 * first frame, and stays level) but only EDGE_LAND_X of the way in x: a
 * finger put down on a bed's outer frond, 24 px from the wall, reads as the
 * panel's limit - landed at the glass it would be a whole pad's width off
 * the spine and arm no scissors (tank.c SLASH_START_SIDE_PX); landed half
 * way it is beside the spine with the frond inside its reach.
 * One exception to the ramp, x only: travel TOWARD a side wall is stretched
 * from its first px. A swipe at a wall frond is a short thing in the report -
 * the pad runs into the bezel and its center stops 15..25 px short of the
 * limit - so it never travelled far enough to open the ramp, or to be a
 * slash at all (Strato's log, 2026-10-01: starts at x 43..71, lifts at
 * 39..53, 4..20 px apart). The price: within the band, a tap that rolls 8 px
 * toward the wall on a tall frond can snip it. */
