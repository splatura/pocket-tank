# Four boards, one tank: how a change reaches all of them

Since 2026-10-01 the tank runs on three boards, and since 2026-10-08 the
code carries a fourth (the FNK0104S, not yet published). This file is the rule for
changing anything they share - read it before a feature, the way DEVICE.md is
read before a flash.

## The boards

| board | glass | build | simulator | firmware | finds the board by |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Waveshare 1.8 AMOLED (the tank, the reference) | 448 x 368, round corners | default | `make` -> `fishsim` | `tools/flash.sh` (preflight; build dir `fw-build`) | port, `TANK_PORT=` with several on USB |
| Waveshare 1.75C (the bowl) | 466 circle | `TANK_ROUND` | `make ROUND=1` -> `fishsim-round` | `tools/flash_round.sh` (`fw-build-175c`) | its USB serial (`ROUND_SERIAL`, tools/boards.local.sh) |
| Waveshare 2.06 (the watch) | 410 x 502 portrait, 100 px corners | `TANK_WATCH` | `make WATCH=1` -> `fishsim-watch` | `tools/flash_watch.sh` (`fw-build-206`) | its USB serial (`WATCH_SERIAL`, tools/boards.local.sh) |
| Freenove FNK0104S | 480 x 320 LCD | `TANK_LCD40` | `make FNK=1` -> `fishsim-lcd40` | `tools/flash_lcd40.sh` (`fw-build-lcd40`) | its USB serial (`LCD40_SERIAL`) |

Each board's own traps are in its doc (board-amoled-1.75c.md,
board-amoled-2.06-watch.md, board-fnk0104s.md).

## What is shared, and where a board may differ

One source tree, one save layout, one model. A board is a compile-time world:

- **The world** (`common/tank.h`): `TANK_W` / `TANK_H`, the floor `TANK_BOT`,
  the walls `TANK_FX0` / `TANK_FX1`, the film grid, the beds. The game is
  written against these names.
- **The page** (`common/render.h`): every page is laid out in a 448 x 368
  PAGE space that sits centered on the glass at `PAGE_X` / `PAGE_Y`. The fish
  live in TANK coordinates, the pages draw in PAGE coordinates: anything that
  crosses over subtracts `PAGE_X` / `PAGE_Y` (a tap coming in, a ring round a
  fish going out).
- **The ports** (`firmware/main/*_port_*`, `board_pins.h`): the chips.

A board `#ifdef` belongs in those three places only: the geometry in tank.h,
a layout-constant block in render.h / render.c / update.c, a port. If a
feature's LOGIC needs `#ifdef TANK_ROUND`, the feature is written against a
pixel instead of a name - fix that instead.

## The rules for a feature

1. **Write it once, in `common/`.** The platforms only route: the page
   returns what was tapped (`MS_TAP_*`, `SHOP_TAP_*`, ...), the sim's loop and
   the firmware's touch port do the same few lines with it. The route is
   written twice (sim/main.c and touch_port_ft3168.c + main.c - every
   board shares the firmware's), so keep it to a call or two and put the
   behavior behind it. Sounds go through `tank_emit`, not through the
   platform.
2. **Lay new page elements out in the box every glass shows whole:** PAGE
   x 56..392, y 60..300 (the modal's box). The watch shows PAGE x 19..428, the
   bowl's circle is at least that wide between those rows; the corners of the
   page are lost on every board but the 1.8 (the bowl's and the watch's bezel,
   the FNK0104S's 320 px height). A page that must use
   the corners gets a layout block per board (the milestones page's
   `MSP_*`), not scattered conditions.
3. **Give the layout a voice.** A test, the director or a tool that needs to
   tap something asks the page where it is (`render_milestones_card`,
   `render_milestones_row`, `render_milestones_arrow`) or uses the layout's
   named constants with `PAGE_X` / `PAGE_Y`. A literal pixel in a test is a
   test for one board.
4. **A save field only ever appends** (progression.c's SAVE LAYOUT LOCK), and
   the save means the same on every board.
5. **Nothing is done until every board says so:**

   | step | command (from the project root) | what it proves |
   |---|---|---|
   | the checks | `make -C pocket-tank/sim check-all` | every selftest on every world |
   | the pictures | `pocket-tank/tools/board_sheet.py --selftest-card` (or `--snapshot 20`) | the same page on every glass, side by side, cut to each glass |
   | the firmware | `pocket-tank/tools/flash.sh` builds the 1.8; `flash_round.sh --build-only`, `flash_watch.sh --build-only`, `flash_lcd40.sh --build-only` | it compiles for each board; compare `.bss` with the last flashed build (internal RAM is ~23 KB) |
   | the glass | flash the 1.8 first (it is the reference and has the preflight), then the others | Strato's finger |

   The handoff entry for a feature says where each board stands: checked /
   pictured / built / flashed / tried on the glass. "Not flashed" is a fine
   state; "unknown" is not.

## Releases

One image per board, one release number. Built 2026-10-02 for 0.3.0 (Strato:
the bowl and the watch ship in 0.3.0; nothing public until the release):

| piece | how a board is kept to its own image |
|---|---|
| the board's id | `common/version.h` `PT_BOARD`: `amoled18`, `round175c`, `watch206` (from `TANK_ROUND` / `TANK_WATCH`) |
| the image | a board marker right after the app descriptor (`net_port_esp.c` `pt_board_marker`, at `PT_BOARD_MARKER_OFFSET` 0x120; kept by `-u pt_board_marker` in firmware/main/CMakeLists.txt). `tools/pt_boards.py` reads it back from a `.bin` |
| over the air | each board fetches `latest-<PT_BOARD>.json`; `common/update.c` refuses a manifest whose `board` is another (WRONG BOARD, never offered); the download reads the marker back from the slot at its first 4 KB and aborts on another board's (`NET_ERR_BOARD`) - all three share the signing key, so the signature alone would let a bowl install the 1.8's image |
| the release | `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds `firmware/build`, `build-round`, `build-watch`; `make_ota_manifest.py` names both files from the image's marker (`latest-<board>.json`, `pocket_tank-v<rel>-<board>.bin`) |
| the installer | `installer.yml` builds the published boards; `make_installer.py --build-dir <1.8> --board-build <round> --board-build <watch>`: the 1.8 keeps `manifest.json` / `manifest-erase.json`, the others `manifest-<board>[-erase].json`; a board's file that differs from the 1.8's is `<name>-<board>.bin`. The page shows a "Pick your board" step when it carries more than one |
| pocketank.com/install | `tools/build_site.py` offers a board only once its manifest is LIVE on GitHub Pages - the public resync is the release, so a site publish before it shows the 1.8 alone |

Nothing reaches the public before the release: the dev repo is private, the
workflows publish only from `mediacutlet/pocket-tank`, the site gates on the
live manifests, and the 0.3.0 changelog entry is a `"draft"`. The resync must
carry `tools/pt_boards.py`. A cable install of the wrong board's image is not
caught on the board (the page's picker is the guard); it boots blank and the
right install puts it back, the save untouched.

### Published, and known (2026-10-08)

A board can be known to the tools before it ships. `tools/pt_boards.py` lists
every board (`IDS`, so a stray image is still recognised) and carries a
published flag per board (`PUBLISHED`). `tools/ci_build.sh` builds the
published boards (with `--known`, every known board: checks.yml's
`firmware-compile` job, so an unpublished board still compiles under CI's
ESP-IDF and is never shipped), and `release.yml` and `installer.yml` take their builds
and the expected set of manifests from that list instead of counting to three.
So one flag publishes a board, and leaving it off never breaks the others.
The FNK0104S is known and not published: its row is `False` until the bench
acceptance in docs/board-fnk0104s.md passes. Its image carries the marker
`fnk0104s`; `make_installer.py --include-unpublished` makes a local test page.

## What the first feature under these rules found (2026-10-01)

The fish card's RENAME and SELL were built this way. Two things turned up
that only the other boards could show:

- The ring round the fish being named (the first run, the color page, the
  birth announcement) was drawn at the fish's TANK position in PAGE space:
  right on the 1.8, 9 px right and 49 px low on the bowl, 19 px left and
  67 px low on the watch. Seen on the first three-board sheet; fixed in
  setup.c (`fish_ring`).
- Only the 1.8's simulator was ever checked: `make check` built and ran
  `fishsim` alone, and the selftests tapped the rectangle's pixels - 5 of 10
  failed on the bowl, 6 on the watch. Every one was the test, none the game;
  they ask the layout now (the pages' `MSP_*` / `SHP_*` / `SET_*` / `UPD_*`
  numbers live in render.h / update.h for that), and `make check-all` and CI
  run all of them in every board's world.
- Still literal: the `--snapshot` mode's own taps (on the bowl its fry_modal
  picture opens another modal). A picture, not a check - repoint it when it
  is next touched.
