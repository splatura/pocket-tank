"""make_installer.py - assemble the browser installer (ESP Web Tools).

Gathers the firmware build's bootloader / partition table / app, the
shipped model_q4.bin, the installer page and the vendored ESP Web Tools
bundle into ONE static folder that any HTTPS host can serve as-is:

    installer/dist/
        index.html          the page (version stamped in)
        manifest.json       what to flash where (ESP Web Tools format); the
                            Install button: NEVER erases, so a tank already
                            on the board (its save lives in NVS at 0x9000,
                            which no part touches) carries on after an update
        manifest-erase.json the same parts behind the "start over" button:
                            ESP Web Tools' erase question first
        manifest-<board>.json, manifest-<board>-erase.json
                            the same pair for each other board built
                            (--board-build; 2026-10-02, 0.3.0 ships three):
                            the 1.8 keeps the plain names every page
                            already points at
        firmware/*.bin      bootloader, partition table, app, model; a board's
                            file that differs from the 1.8's is <name>-<board>.bin
        vendor/esp-web-tools-<tag>/*.js   the flasher (Apache-2.0, vendored so the
                                    page has no third-party runtime deps;
                                    the install dialog gets the one-line
                                    never_erase patch below at assembly)

Offsets come from the build's flasher_args.json (bootloader / partition
table / app) and from firmware/partitions.csv (the model partition), so a
layout change can't silently ship a stale offset.

    tools/make_installer.py                      # default build dir
    tools/make_installer.py --build-dir path     # another idf.py -B dir
    tools/make_installer.py --version 1.2.0      # instead of git describe
    tools/make_installer.py --build-dir B18 --board-build BROUND --board-build BWATCH   # the published boards

Each build's board is read from its app image's marker (tools/pt_boards.py),
so a build dir in the wrong slot can never ship under another board's name.

Web Serial needs a secure context: serve the folder over HTTPS (or from
http://localhost for a local check: `python3 -m http.server -d installer/dist`)."""
