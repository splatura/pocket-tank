/* tank.h — platform-agnostic reflex layer for the pocket fish tank.
 *
 * Ported from the browser prototype (llm-fishtank-v0_2.html); same fish,
 * same goals, same drive dynamics, rescaled to the 448x368 landscape tank.
 * World geometry (bubble column, reef, zones) matches model/gen_traces.py so
 * the advisor model sees the world it was trained on.
 *
 * Population (docs/progression-next.md): the tank holds up to N_FISH_MAX fish
 * but only fish[0..n_fish-1] are alive/active. A new tank starts with two
 * adults of contrasting personality; the rest arrive later as fry (the
 * progression layer decides when). Every loop in this file, the renderer and
 * the advisors iterates n_fish, never N_FISH_MAX.
 *
 * No I/O, no floats-to-strings, no OS calls: this file and tank.c compile
 * unchanged for the LVGL PC sim and the ESP32-S3 firmware.
