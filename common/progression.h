/* progression.h — the "shaped by attention, never ruined by absence" layer
 * (docs/progression.md + docs/progression-next.md). Platform-agnostic;
 * persistence and wall-clock come in through two tiny port functions.
 *
 *  - Population: a new tank is two contrasting adults; the 3rd..POP_CAP-th
 *    fish ARRIVE as fry when care milestones are met (trust, feedings, a
 *    calm hold, a raised fry, drift). An arrival is staged when earned; a
 *    few seconds later the parents court down in the nursery grass and the
 *    fry is born there, in front of the keeper (2026-09-24 - it used to wait
 *    for the next light-on). A tank put to sleep first has it at the wake.
 *  - Growth: well-fed fish grow (size) and advance fry -> juv -> adult -> elder
 *    with time - every awake second, light on or off (2026-09-14, Strato:
 *    "fish don't stop growing with the light off"), and a slept span at
 *    SLEEP_GROWTH_FRAC of its length; stage changes are silent surprises.
 *  - Trait drift: bold and social creep with experience (hours of pressure).
 *  - Milestones: firsts are DETECTED from what the fish actually did (the
 *    model's own choices), per fish and per tank; render shows them.
 *  - Habits: the tank remembers where you feed and greets you at light-on.
 *  - Ravenous boot: powered off >= 1 h -> fish are starving on return and wait
 *    near the surface (at your usual feeding spot) until the first feeding.
 *    Nothing else is simulated for time away; nothing ever dies.
 *  - Saves: on events (arrival, stage, milestone, light change), coalesced to
 *    >= 30 s apart, plus a 10-minute heartbeat - NVS-friendly. */
