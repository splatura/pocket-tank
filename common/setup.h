/* setup.h — first-run setup (2026-09-13): the welcome, a name and colours for
 * each of the two fry, then the care tips - for a fresh install and after a
 * reset. Platform-agnostic: the state machine, the gestures, the hit
 * geometry and the drawing all live here (the reset prompt kept its state in
 * each platform's touch code; a five-page flow would have been written
 * twice), built on render.h's UI primitives over the LIVE tank - the fish
 * keep swimming behind the pages and wear the colours as they are picked.
 *
 * The platforms do three things: setup_begin when progression says the flow
 * is pending (boot, a reset YES, the director's cue); setup_touch every
 * frame with the finger's position and state while it is up (taps and the
 * letter-wheel drags are classified here); and render_setup after
 * render_tank while setup_active. Every other gesture is swallowed while it
 * is up. No timeout: it waits for the keeper.
 *
 * PLACE THE BUBBLES (2026-09-13, Strato's idea): right after the welcome,
 * over the live tank - a finger anywhere on the water drags the bubble
 * column to that x (tank_set_bubble_x keeps it clear of the grass corner the fish rest by); a translucent stripe marks the column, the airstone at its foot
 * moves with it, the bubbles already rising shift as one.
 *
 * Naming (third design, Strato: "seeing the fish while naming it is very
 * important" - and a keyboard's keys are too small for a 35 mm glass): NO
 * panel - the tank stays in view with a ring around the fish being named -
 * and seven big letter slots across the middle, arcade high-score style.
 * Touch a slot to pick it, then drag up / down on it (or tap the chevrons
 * above and below) to spin its letter through blank, A..Z. A blank at the
 * end shortens the name; NEXT trims blanks and puts the preset's name back
 * if nothing is left. Targets are a slot wide (44 px) and the whole band
 * tall, so nothing here needs aim.
 *
 * THE BIRTH FLOW (2026-09-14, Strato: an arrival "will be an exciting event
 * for the player"): when progression says a fry is owed its welcome
 * (progression_newborn), setup_poll_birth opens three pages over the live
 * tank - A NEW FRY! (the announcement: the fry ringed wherever it hatched,
 * its parents named), NAME THE NEW FRY (the letter wheel, as in the first
 * run) and the family page (a panel: the fry's portrait on its own, as it
 * is now; whose body and whose markings it wears; its boldness and
 * sociability on bars between its parents' marks). No colour picker - a
 * fry's look is its family's (tank_add_fish). DONE clears the debt and
 * saves the name; a cancel (director `setup off`, sim S) leaves it owed, so
 * it returns at the next boot. */
/* PLACE A PIECE (2026-09-16, Strato: a bought plant or decoration "should
 * allow the player to place the piece wherever they like ... similar to the
 * bubble column placement experience", plus a z-layer): one page over the
 * live tank, opened by the platform right after a purchase (and by the
 * shop's MOVE button for a piece already in the tank). A finger on the
 * water drags the piece to that x (tank_decor_set clamps it inside the
 * window); a BACK / MIDDLE / FRONT row under the title picks its depth -
 * the tank redraws live, so the fish and the grass show the choice at
 * once; DONE saves. A translucent stripe marks the piece's footprint, a
 * chevron at its foot. */
