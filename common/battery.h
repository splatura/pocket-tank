/* battery.h — the keeper's view of the battery (2026-09-24, Strato: "i cant
 * really tell [when it is charging] at the moment, perhaps its my color
 * blindness" + a page behind a tap on the pill).
 *
 * The pill's four states (render_battery draws them apart by SHAPE and
 * MOTION, never by hue alone), and the history behind the info page:
 * when the cable last went in or out, the screen-on time since, and this
 * cell's own drain / charge rates, learned stretch by stretch. Platform-
 * free: the device feeds it the gauge once a second and keeps bat_hist_t
 * in NVS (its own "bat" namespace - a tank reset leaves it); the sim feeds
 * it a pretend cell. Every number is gauge percent: the AXP2101 has no
 * current sense, so rates are % per hour, measured off the gauge itself. */
