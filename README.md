# pocket-tank 🐟

**A tiny language model keeps a fish tank alive on an $8 chip.**
The ESP32-S3 board, with screen and battery used in this project is actually around $35.

A 14-million-parameter transformer, distilled from a 26-billion-parameter
teacher, runs entirely on an ESP32-S3 microcontroller and makes every
high-level decision for a small aquarium of virtual fish: when to eat, hide,
explore, socialize, rest, or flee. No network. No cloud. The whole brain is a
7.56 MB file read straight from flash, and the tank lives on a 1.8-inch AMOLED
you can hold in one hand.

The fish aren't scripted. Each one periodically describes its situation to the
model as a single line of text (hunger, energy, fear, who's nearby, its own
personality) and the model completes the line with a goal and an urgency. A
reflex layer turns that goal into motion at 25 to 30 frames per second. When
the model isn't sure, the fish visibly *hesitates*.

```

This repo is the complete project: the trained model, the distillation
pipeline that made it, a PC simulator, and the firmware for a real board.
Got the board? **[Install it from your browser](https://pocketank.com/install/)**,
no toolchain needed.

The current release is **v0.3.3** (alpha); the settings page shows the one
on your tank. What changed in each release:
**[pocketank.com/updates](https://pocketank.com/updates/)**.

It runs on three Waveshare boards: the 1.8-inch original, the round
1.75-inch **pendant**, where the tank fills the whole circle like a little
fishbowl, and the 2.06-inch **watch**, a tall tank you can wear. Same fish,
same shop, same saves on all three. From 0.3 on a tank updates itself
over Wi-Fi, so the cable is only for the first install.

## The numbers

| | Teacher | Student (what ships) |
|---|---|---|
| Model | gemma4:26b | pocket-tank 14.3M (dim 384, 8 layers, 8 heads) |
| Parameters | ~26,000,000,000 | 14,300,000, about 1,818× fewer |
| Size | ~18 GB (Q4_K_M) | 57 MB fp32 → **7.56 MB 4-bit** |
| Vocabulary | ~262K tokens | **54 tokens** (a closed schema lexicon) |
| Runs on | A desktop GPU | ESP32-S3, from flash, no network |
| Agreement | | 72% picks the teacher's goal (the teacher agrees with *itself* 82%) |

On the real board a decision takes about 3.7 s at 12 tokens per second, with
the tank rendering at 25 to 30 fps alongside it on the other core. Trained on
51,613 teacher-labeled situations. Every measured number, learning curve, and
the methodology: [docs/stats.md](docs/stats.md).

## How it's put together

Three layers, strictly separated, all in `common/` and compiled unchanged
into both the simulator and the firmware:

- **Reflex layer** (`tank.c`). Physics, steering, schooling, touch gestures,
  feeding, the hunger economy, vegetation and algae. Runs every frame and
  never blocks on the model.
- **LLM advisor** (`llm/`). A llama2.c-style 4-bit inference engine, a
  word-level tokenizer, and one shared state encoder. Fish are re-asked only
  when their situation meaningfully changes, so four to six fish share one
  brain without anyone starving for a turn. The model runs on the second core
  of the ESP32-S3 with SIMD dot products and quantized activations in
  internal SRAM; the weights are memory-mapped from flash and never copied.
- **Progression** (`progression.c`). The long game: growth, arrivals, trait
  drift, milestones, habits, persistence. Everything survives a power cut.

One deliberate rule: **the model owns its decisions.** There are no fallback
heuristics second-guessing it. If the model picks a goal, the fish commits.
Uncertainty shows up as visible hesitation, not a silent override. The reflex
layer only ever *performs* what the model chose, or stages presentations
(begging, courtship, greeting) that the model's own state has earned.

## What the fish do

Seven goals, from the browser prototype this project distills from:
`seek_food`, `follow_friend`, `inspect_reef`, `visit_bubbles`, `explore`,
`rest`, `dart_play`. (An eighth, `flee_shadow`, answered a roaming shadow
that was removed from the tank in September 2026; the token stays in the
vocabulary and the model was never taught to say it.) Each fish has five
drives (hunger, energy, stress, curiosity, boredom), three personality
traits (bold, sociable, lazy), a trust score toward you, and a life stage.
All of it is in the state line, so a bold fish and a shy one answer the same
situation differently, and the model was taught by example rather than by
rules.

**Boredom** is what keeps the tank moving. A fish that has been at the same
pastime for about a minute goes stale, and the model was taught that a bored
fish moves on, usually to explore a part of the tank it hasn't seen in a
while; a fresh fish keeps doing what it was doing. Before this the fish
would park at the bubble column, or follow each other in circles, for as
long as you cared to watch. Boredom never outranks hunger, and a bored fish
at night still rests.

The model samples its own distribution instead of always taking the top
answer. That restores the variety the teacher had and costs nothing on
survival: a starving fish picks `seek_food` 89% of the time at minimum across
every personality. When the top two choices are close, the fish pauses for a
moment before committing.

Fish turn the way real ones do. A fish whose way lies behind it commits to
turning round instead of flip-flopping: it glances back first, then its
head swings through a head-on view, the body shortening toward the glass
and the tail following a beat behind, and it pulls away. Its body stays
near level as it rises and sinks.

![The stats card](docs/media/sim-stats-card.png)

Tap a fish for its stats card, its name at the top. Needs, traits, and trust are revealed as the
fish shows that side of itself, so a new fish's card is mostly blank. The
MORE button at its foot (or a tap anywhere on the card) opens the milestones
page, where the SETTINGS and UPGRADES buttons live.

## The living tank

Everything below is detected from what actually happens in the tank, never
scripted, and it is all persisted.

**Growing up.** A new tank starts with two fry. Feed them and over days they
grow through juvenile, adult, and elder. A fry is plain; its markings come
in with its first growth spurt. Adults get a dorsal crest; elders
get bigger and settle down. Nothing announces it. Fish grow with time, lit
or not, and at a quarter speed while the tank sleeps; a stage reached in
the night is the morning's surprise.

**Arrivals.** Take good care of the pair and the tank earns more fish, up to
five, one at a time. Each arrival has conditions (trust, feedings, a fish
grown up, a hold-approach) and the tank *tells* you when it's close: the two
most trusting adults dive into the sea grass and circle low through it.
Once every condition is met, the pair goes down into the grass within half
a minute and courts, and a few seconds into the dance there's a fry between
them, light on or off. Put the tank to sleep before that and the fry is
there when it wakes. A bed has to be tall enough to hide in before courtship
starts or a fry can be born.

**Trust.** Hold a finger on the glass for three seconds and the fish that
trust you come over from anywhere in the tank, the most trusting first and
fastest. Rap three times and nearby fish scatter and stay spooked. Calm holds
earn trust, startles cost it, and the model reads trust as part of every
decision, so a fish that trusts you acts differently in every situation.

**Hunger.** A meal lasts five or six minutes awake. Left alone, the tank
drops a pellet only when someone is really hungry, so an untended tank hovers
between fed and peckish. Wake it after hours asleep and the school is
ravenous: they gather just under the surface where you usually feed them,
darting back and forth, and go into a frenzy when the pellets land. The tank
holds off feeding itself while they beg, so the first meal is yours.

**Upkeep.** The sea grass keeps growing, every frond on its own, right up to
the surface. A sideways stroke that starts on the grass cuts exactly the
fronds it crosses at the height of your finger; a sweep along the floor mows
a bed down to nubs. Algae films the glass over hours and a drag across it
squeegees it clean. Fish like cover: grass calms them, and only a tank truly
smothered by two beds at the ceiling stresses them.

**The sponge and the scissors.** One stroke can wipe and trim at once, and
sometimes you only want one. Tap a fish and look under its card: two small
tools. Pick the sponge and your strokes only wipe algae and leave the grass
alone; pick the scissors and they only trim. While a tool is in your hand
the glass takes its strokes and nothing else: no feeding, no cards, no
light, no moving a decoration. A DONE chip sits top left: tap it to put the
tool back, or leave it and it goes back by itself after two minutes.

![The sponge and the scissors under a fish's card](docs/media/sim-tools.png)
![The scissors in hand: DONE at the top left](docs/media/sim-tool-done.png)

**Milestones.** Tap MORE on the open stats card for the milestones page: a row per
fish with its sprite at its real size, its name and a growth strip, then a
badge for each first it has chosen to do: first meal from you, first
hold-approach, first reef, first bubbles, first follow, first dart. The
tank's row below tracks the population and the firsts you share: first
feeding, first trimming, first glass cleaning, first full night's sleep,
first play session, the tank changed someone. A locked badge is the same
picture as a gray silhouette; one earned since you last looked wears a
ring. Tap a badge to read it: a small panel with arrows at its top corners
that step through the rest of the group without going back to the page (a
fish's six badges, the tank's six, the fry's gates, or the fish themselves
from a fish's name); tap anywhere else to dismiss. At the foot of the
page: SETTINGS, UPGRADES (the shop) and CLOSE. The shop's and the settings
page's own CLOSE bring you back here, not out to the tank.

**The next fry.** While the tank can still grow, a NEW FRY row sits under
the last fish: what the next arrival needs, as badges that light up when
met, with a filling bar under each one still owed. The list is read from
the same rule that decides a birth, so it is never wrong: at two fish it
is trust, meals and a calm hold; later the youngest must grow up, and the
counts rise; and always clean glass and some grass, because no fry is
conceived in a dirty tank (film on more than 15% of the pane closes the
gate, and its bar fills as you wipe). Tap a badge for the plain words and where it stands ("ALL FISH
MUST HAVE TRUST OF AT LEAST 6 OUT OF 10 / LOWEST NOW 4.1"), and HOW? for a
tip on how to get there. Tap the name for the tally. When every step is
done, the parents court in the grass and the fry is born within the minute.

**Rename or sell a fish.** On the milestones page, tap a fish's name to
open its card. RENAME brings back the letter wheel. SELL, tapped twice,
trades the fish for sand dollars, and older fish are worth more: 5 for a
fry, 15 for a juvenile, 30 for an adult, 60 for an elder. A tank keeps at
least two fish, and after a sale the next fry waits for 12 more meals.

**More badges, and the school at a glance.** Each fish can earn *first rest
in the seagrass*. The tank can earn *a school of ten shrimp*, and the reef
badge now belongs to the tank: buy the reef cluster and the fish swim over
to visit it. When the tank's row of badges is full, an arrow (or a swipe
along the row) shows its next page. Tap the tank's fish count to see every
fish in its own colors, with an outline for each open place.

**Sand dollars.** Caring for the tank earns points, and the shop spends
them on things for the tank. A meal the fish eat from your hand pays 2; a
fish growing up pays 5, 10 and 25 for juvenile, adult and elder; a fry
born 20; a fish that comes to trust you completely 15; every hundred algae
colonies you wipe away pay 25, and so does every 250 cm of grass you
cut, again and again. Nothing is ever needed and nothing is lost: a tank with no
sand dollars is exactly the tank there was before. The coin on the
milestones page's TANK row shows your balance, and it (or the UPGRADES
button) opens the shop: a row per item with its price, UNLOCK when you can
afford it, IN TANK once you own it, and HOW TO EARN for the list. Three
things to buy so far. The **sword plant** (40) is a fourth bed of broad
leaves on the open floor, trimmed and grown and counted as cover like the
grass. The **snail** (80) grazes the glass clean cell by cell, crawling
flat across the pane with its head leading, and walks the floor upright
when there is nothing to eat, in front of a piece you placed IN FRONT or
behind it as it pleases; it keeps working while the tank sleeps, so
the glass is thinner in the morning. It is drawn the way the fish, the
grass and the castle are, from a little geometry rather than a sprite, lit
from the upper left and tinted by the water of its row, and it moves like
a snail: waves run along its foot, its eye stalks sway, its shell rocks
with the crawl. Tap the snail for its card: a ring
around it and a tally of the spots of algae it has grazed clean so far,
night shifts included. The model sees neither: they reach
the fish the way your own chores do, through cover and the film. Dollars
earned while you watch show as a small "+N" over the water.

**Placing what you buy.** A plant is yours to put down. Right after you
unlock it the shop closes and a placement page comes up over the live
water, the same gesture as placing the bubble column: drag it left or
right along the floor and it follows your finger. A DEPTH bar sets where
it stands among the fish, and instead of words to decode it shows three
small pictures of your own first fish with two leaves, swimming over them,
through them, or behind them: BEHIND, AMONG or IN FRONT. The tank redraws
as you choose, a line under the bar says what to watch for, and DONE keeps
it. If you change your mind later, the plant's row in the shop has a MOVE
button that opens the same page again. The snail is not for placing; it
goes wherever the algae is.

**The castle.** The third thing in the shop (150) is a stone castle with
a swim-through arch: two pointed towers, a crenellated wall, a taller
rear tower, a brick arch and moss creeping up from a rubble base. It is
not a sprite. Like the fish and the grass it is drawn from a little
geometry every time the scene is built, its stone a brick pattern from a
position hash, lit from the upper left and tinted with the water of each
row, so it sits in the tank instead of on it. Its placement page has the
same drag and a DEPTH bar of two choices that mean the plant layer:
BEHIND puts it behind the grass and the fish, a ruin in the weeds; IN
FRONT stands it in front of the grass, which stops at its walls, and the
fish swim through the arch, tucked behind the jambs as they pass. The
fish do not know it is there. They find the arch by chance, which is most
of the charm.

**The coral.** The fourth thing in the shop (100) is a branching coral,
drawn from a little skeleton of rounded branches on a chunky pixel grid:
a dark rim on the shaded side, a lit edge toward the light, pale tips,
and a speckled body in whatever colour you give it. Its placement page
has the drag, a DEPTH bar of two choices (BEHIND or IN FRONT, like the
castle's), and a COLOR row of eight swatches; the coral on the floor wears
the pick as you tap, and the
shop's MOVE button brings the page back whenever you want a change. It
also grows, and slowly, which nothing else in the tank does: you buy a
young but established fan, the trunk and its two low branches, and over
about seventeen days, awake or asleep, the rest of the branches reach out
one by one until the fan is complete. It tops out about a quarter of the
way up the glass and stays there. Then, over the following week, a crown
of nine thin tentacles sprouts from the tip and sways on the tank clock.
It is anchored: its base sits down in the pebbles and a low hump of the
floor's own stones is heaped round it, so the trunk grows out of the floor
instead of standing on it.

**The reef cluster.** The fifth thing in the shop, and the dearest (240),
lives on the shop's second page: the header's arrows flip to it. It is a
whole mature reef on a pile of stones, drawn the same procedural way from
Strato's cluster art: a branching coral to the left, four tube sponges
with dark mouths, a lobed brain coral in front, green weed between the
stones, about twice the coral's footprint. You buy it big, at 85% of its
full size, because a keeper buying a coral wants something to look at on
day one; over two weeks it fills out to full size, and over the two weeks
after that it blooms, up to forty-eight thin tentacles appearing one at a
time round the tube mouths, the coral's tips and the brain's top, every
one swaying. Its placement page has the drag, the two depths, and a LOOK
row of three tiles instead of a colour: REEF is the art's orange, purple
and cyan; LAGOON is pink, blue and lime; DUSK is magenta, teal and gold.
It sits in a hump of stones like the coral.

**The shrimp school.** The sixth thing in the shop (180), on the second
page beside the reef. Four cherry shrimp arrive as a loose school, drawn by
code pixel by pixel like everything else that swims, and turning the same
way the fish do. They keep to the foot of the grass most of the time,
wander out onto the sand, and now and then drift slowly up a bed to the top
of its canopy. They are the tank's cleanup crew: a pellet that sinks below
the top of the grass is theirs, still falling or resting on the floor
(pellets now rest there fifteen seconds before they dissolve), and the
school crowds in to peck it clean. Every ten pellets they eat brings another
shrimp, up to ten, never two within fifteen minutes. With more than half
the glass covered in algae they refuse food: they keep to the grass and
turn away from pellets, so the school stops growing until you wipe the
glass (it never shrinks). Tap the school for its card: how many, the
pellets they have eaten, and ten pips toward the next shrimp. Three quick
taps on them scare them like the fish: they flick away tail first and
regroup.

**The sea urchin.** The seventh thing in the shop (120). It lives on the
sand and nibbles the tallest grass down a little at a time. It never cuts
the grass short and it leaves the sword plant alone, so there is still
trimming for you to do. Tap it for its card: how much grass it has eaten so
far, and whether it is grazing or resting.

**The night shift.** The snail and the urchin keep working while the tank
sleeps. A tank with a snail wakes up with about a third less algae on the
glass, and a tank with an urchin wakes up to shorter grass. Helpers take
the edge off a long sleep; they never take the chores away.

**Selling back, and the short way to a piece.** Tap and hold a still
finger on any decoration in the tank and its placement page opens right
there, with MOVE, DEPTH and, in the top-left corner, SELL. The same SELL
sits next to MOVE in the shop's modal for anything you own. A sale needs
two taps: the first arms the button and shows the refund, the second
sells. You get 20% of the price back, the piece leaves the tank, and it is
in the shop again at full price. The snail and the shrimp are not for
sale; they are permanent residents.

**The light.** Two quick taps on the glass turn the tank light off and on;
in the dark the fish rest and the palette dims. The first time a double-tap
turns the light off, a small LIGHTS OUT notice says what happened and how
to turn it back on, once per tank. The settings page has a
LIGHTS OUT row that can hand the light to the tank instead: step it from
DOUBLE-TAP to a time, 5 seconds up to 30 minutes. The tank knows when it
is being handled (the motion sensor, or a touch) and goes dark by itself
after that long still, so a tank left on the desk is asleep until you pick
it up. Six hours of device sleep in one stretch earns the tank its first
full night's sleep.

**Feeding is yours if you want it.** The tank drops a pellet now and then
when someone is hungry, so nobody goes without. AUTO FEED on the settings
page turns that off: then every meal is one you gave. Nobody dies of it,
but a fish left starving in a lit tank slowly loses trust, and feeding it
stops the loss.

![The battery page, charging](docs/media/sim-battery-page.png)

**The battery.** A small battery sits top right whenever a fish's card is
open, and stays up by itself when the charge runs low. On the cable a
lightning bolt stands beside it, and while it charges a bright band runs
through the fill, so you never have to tell two colors apart to know it is
charging. Plug the tank in and the battery shows itself for a few seconds
to say it noticed. Tap it for the battery page: the charge, whether it is
charging, about how long it will last (or how long until it is full), how
long ago it was unplugged, the screen-on time since, and how long a full
charge lasts. The tank learns those times from its own battery as you use
it.

**Updates over Wi-Fi.** The settings page has an UPDATES button. Tap CHECK
FOR UPDATES and the tank pauses, turns its radio on and looks for a newer
release. The first time, it lists the networks it can see; pick yours and
type the password on the glass. If there is a new version it downloads it,
checks it and restarts into it, and your fish are right where you left
them. Below about 20% battery it asks you to plug in first. If an update
ever goes wrong, the tank goes back to the version it had. The radio is
only on during a check: the tank itself still runs with no network at all.
On the watch, settings also has a SCREEN row: NORMAL, or TURNED if you wear
it with the buttons toward your elbow. The original and the pendant turn
their picture over by themselves when you turn the tank over; the ROTATION
button on the settings page (a padlock in a turning arrow) locks the
picture the way up it is.

![The updates page](docs/media/sim-updates.png)
![Choosing a network](docs/media/sim-update-networks.png)

**Habits and continuity.** The tank remembers where you feed it and greets
the light coming on. A real-time clock tells it how long it was off, so a
tank left dark for a day wakes hungry. One key does all of it: a short
press on PWR puts the tank to sleep - it saves and the screen goes dark -
and a press wakes it. Press again within twenty minutes and the tank
simply resumes where it was, on a tap; after that it powers itself down to
the board's deepest state (tens of microamps, months on the shelf), and the
next press wakes it with a one-second boot, the fish having lived through
the time away: hunger up, energy back, the grass and the algae grown, a
long night ending in begging at the surface. One thing to know about that
deepest sleep: the only chip still awake is the power-management chip, and
its rule is that the key must be held for about an eighth of a second
before it turns the board on - a quick tap does nothing. Press it like you
mean it. The tank decides how deep it sleeps; you never do. Holding PWR
powers it off at once. Hold BOOT and tap the glass to reset the tank. Flip
the device and the screen follows.

**First run.** A new tank, whether a fresh install or a reset, opens with a
short setup over the live water. A welcome page; then you place the bubble
column, dragging it left or right across the tank while the bubbles and
the airstone follow your finger; then each of the two fry in
turn: the fish being introduced swims a slow loop front and center with a
ring around it while you name it on an arcade-style letter wheel (touch a
slot, drag up or down to spin its letter, or tap the chevrons above and
below it), then you pick its body color from eight swatches and watch the
fry wear it. Its accent stays a question mark: a fry has no markings yet,
and they come in as it grows. A page of care tips finishes the tour. The
light stays on throughout, and the column, the names and the colors you
chose are saved with the tank.

![Naming a fish on the letter wheel](docs/media/sim-setup-name.png)

**A birth.** Every arrival is an event. The fry hatches low in the nursery
grass wearing its family's colors, the body of one parent and the markings
of the other, and the tank stops to introduce it. *A new fry!* rings the
newcomer wherever it is and names its parents; the next page is the same
letter wheel, so you name it; the last page shows the fry on its own, as it
is now, with what it inherited: whose body, whose markings, and how bold
and sociable it is on bars marked with each parent's own value. Its
markings, like any fry's, come in as it grows. The welcome is saved with
the tank until you finish it, so a fry born while you were away is waiting
for you when you come back.

![Naming the new fry](docs/media/sim-birth-name_new.png)
![The family page: what it inherited](docs/media/sim-birth-family.png)

**Starting over.** Hold BOOT and tap the glass: a *Reset tank?* prompt
appears over the water with a NO and a YES. YES wipes the save and two new
fry take the tank, with the first-run setup to name them; NO, a sleep, or
twenty seconds of silence keep everything.

## Try it: PC simulator

The simulator runs the exact same `common/` code inside an LVGL + SDL2
window, with the shipped model as the brain. Needs SDL2 and LVGL v9 (cloned
in-tree):

```bash

On macOS the Makefile targets x86_64 by default to match an Intel Homebrew
SDL2; use `make ARCH=` for a native build. On Linux it builds for the host. The other worlds: `make ROUND=1`
(`fishsim-round`), `make WATCH=1` (`fishsim-watch`) and `make FNK=1`
(`fishsim-lcd40`, the Freenove FNK0104S's 480×320 glass).
The trained model
(`model/out/model_q4.bin` + `tokenizer.bin`) ships in the repo, so the LLM
brain works out of the box.

In the window, the mouse is your finger: tap the water surface or drag down
from the top edge to feed, click a fish for its stats card (the shrimp for
theirs), click the card
(or its MORE button) for milestones, hold the button to rest a finger on the glass, three quick
clicks to startle, two to toggle the light, drag across the glass to wipe
algae, and stroke sideways through a bed to trim it. Keys: **F** feed at the
mouse, **N** light, **A** auto light, **H** handle the tank (moving the
mouse over the window counts too), **L** switch
between the rule stub and the LLM brain, **U** overlays, **M** milestones,
**4** the shop, **D** fifty sand dollars to try it, **W** the shrimp school
(again adds one),
**X** the reset prompt, **S** the first-run setup (or drops a birth's pages), **R** force an arrival
(the birth flow opens), **Z** jump through seven
hours of sleep, **G** grow the grass and algae now, **V** volume, **B** the
low-battery notice, **P** plug or unplug a pretend battery (click the
battery for its page), **Q** quit.

Flags: `--fresh` starts a new random tank, `--fast N` runs tended time N×
faster so you can watch fish grow up, `--greedy` disables sampling,
`--narrate` prints every decision as it's made, `--battery N` starts the
pretend battery at N%, `--snapshot <prefix>` writes
PPM frames of the tank, card, milestones page, the shop, the placement
page, the castle (in front, behind, its page), the battery in each state
and its page, reset prompt, the setup pages, and the three pages of a birth.

Headless checks, all of which run in CI-style without a window:
`--selftest` (reflex layer), `--selftest-llm [min]` (the real model),
`--selftest-pop` (arrivals, inherited looks, saves, the setup and birth flows), `--selftest-sleep` (sleep metabolism,
the deep-sleep wake, and ravenous begging), `--selftest-hunger` (the hunger economy),
`--selftest-tend` (grass, algae, trust holds), `--selftest-shop` (sand
dollars, the shop, the plant, the snail), `--selftest-battery` (the battery
page's numbers, and the bolt only on the cable), and `--bench` (render cost).
`make check` from `sim/` runs every selftest.

## Try it: firmware in QEMU

The ESP-IDF v5.4 app boots in Espressif's QEMU with the real hardware
configuration (octal 8 MB PSRAM) and the model partition populated:

```bash
cd firmware && ./run_qemu.sh
```

You'll watch an emulated ESP32-S3 memory-map the 7.56 MB model from flash
and start making decisions, about 2.3 s each in emulation. The display and
touch ports are stubs in the QEMU overlay; decisions go to the log.

## Install from your browser

The easy way onto a board: **https://pocketank.com/install/**.
Plug the Waveshare board into your computer, open the page in Chrome or Edge,
pick your board (the 1.8, the pendant or the watch), click *Install Pocket
Tank*, pick the port, and watch the bar fill. Then the page asks for your
Wi-Fi: the tank's screen stays dark while it lists the networks it can see,
you pick yours and type the password, and the tank connects to check it
before it starts. That is what lets it update itself later; you can skip
it and set it up on the tank instead. About
8 MB goes over in a minute or two, the board reboots on its own, and two fry
are waiting.

**After that, updates come over Wi-Fi.** 0.3 is the last release that
needs the cable: a tank on 0.2 installs it from the page once, and from
then on CHECK FOR UPDATES on the settings page does the rest. Each board
fetches only its own image, every image is signed, and a tank refuses one
that is not signed by this project or was built for another board.
[docs/OTA.md](docs/OTA.md) has the design.

**Updating by cable is the same click.** The installer never erases the board: it
rewrites the app and the model, and the tank's save lives in a part of the
flash (NVS at `0x9000`) that none of the four parts cover, so your fish,
their names, trust, history, badges, sand dollars and decorations carry on.
Every version loads the saves of every earlier one (the save only ever grows
at the tail, and the one field that went in mid-struct is slid into place on
load). To start over, hold BOOT and tap the glass for the *Reset tank?*
prompt; the page also has an "erase and install fresh" button for a board
that won't get that far. The settings page shows the release at its foot,
small and dim ("V0.3.3 ALPHA", then the build id), so you can tell what
you run. It is the same mechanism ESPHome and Home
Assistant use ([ESP Web Tools](https://esphome.github.io/esp-web-tools/)),
running entirely in the browser over Web Serial.

To host your own copy, `tools/make_installer.py` turns a firmware build plus
the shipped model into one static folder (`installer/dist/`: the page, a
manifest with the four parts and their flash offsets, the binaries, and the
vendored flasher). Any HTTPS static host will do, GitHub Pages included;
[installer/README.md](installer/README.md) has the details.

## Run it on real hardware

Three Waveshare boards are supported, all ESP32-S3R8 with 16 MB flash and
8 MB PSRAM, an AMOLED, capacitive touch, an IMU and a PMIC, and a fourth, the
Freenove FNK0104S, is built and waiting for the bench:

| Board | Glass | Build |
|---|---|---|
| **ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.8** (V1 and V2, auto-detected) | 368×448, shown as a 448×368 tank | the default |
| **ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75C**, the pendant | 466 px circle | `sdkconfig.round` |
| **ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.06**, the watch | 410×502, portrait | `sdkconfig.watch` |
| **Freenove FNK0104S**, 4.0" LCD (coming: bench testing; not in the installer) | 480×320 | `sdkconfig.lcd40` |

Each board's touch panel is calibrated in its touch port, so a tap lands
where the finger is. [docs/BOARDS.md](docs/BOARDS.md) has what the three
share and where they differ; each board's own traps are in its doc. The
browser installer above is the no-toolchain path; this is the developer one.

```bash
. ~/esp/esp-idf/export.sh
cd firmware && idf.py build
idf.py -p /dev/cu.usbmodem* flash
esptool.py --chip esp32s3 -p /dev/cu.usbmodem* write_flash 0x290000 ../model/out/model_q4.bin
```

The other boards build from the same tree on top of their own fragment,
each in its own build directory:

```bash
idf.py -B build-round -DSDKCONFIG=build-round/sdkconfig "-DSDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.defaults;sdkconfig.round" build
idf.py -B build-watch -DSDKCONFIG=build-watch/sdkconfig "-DSDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.defaults;sdkconfig.watch" build
idf.py -B build-lcd40 -DSDKCONFIG=build-lcd40/sdkconfig "-DSDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.defaults;sdkconfig.lcd40" build
```

Every build is signed, so the first build needs a key: `tools/ota_key.sh`
makes one for you in `firmware/keys/` (never committed). A tank you flash
with your own key takes over-the-air updates only from images signed with
that key, not from this project's releases; the browser installer is the
way onto the release channel.

The model lives in its own 8 MB raw partition and only needs flashing once.
[docs/bringup.md](docs/bringup.md) is the step-by-step checklist with pass
signals for each stage, and [docs/memory_budget.md](docs/memory_budget.md)
explains where every kilobyte goes. The boot log prints a per-stage frame
profile and per-decision inference timings, so performance work is
measurable without instruments.

**Other boards.** This repo supports those three boards, to keep the project small
while it is young. Two community ports run the tank elsewhere. They are not
built or tested here, and they may lag behind this repo:

- [knoopx](https://github.com/knoopx) ported it to the Waveshare
  **ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-4B** (4-inch 720×720 MIPI-DSI panel, GT911
  touch, ES8311 audio) in [their fork](https://github.com/knoopx/pocket-tank).
  It needs ESP-IDF 5.5.
  [Pull request #5](https://github.com/mediacutlet/pocket-tank/pull/5) has
  the details.
- [lmoiseichuk](https://github.com/lmoiseichuk) ported it to the 2.8-inch
  **ES3C28P "cheap yellow display"** (ESP32-S3, 320×240 ILI9341 IPS panel,
  FT6336 touch, ES8311 audio), with every page laid out for the smaller
  screen, in
  [their fork](https://github.com/lmoiseichuk/pocket-tank-cyd/tree/feature/cyd_ES3C28P).
  [Pull request #10](https://github.com/mediacutlet/pocket-tank/pull/10) has
  the details.

## Train your own

The whole distillation pipeline is here. `model/gen_traces.py` runs the
headless tank against any Ollama-served teacher and logs state→goal pairs;
`train_tokenizer.py`, `train.py`, and `export_q4.py` take it from JSONL to a
flashable 4-bit binary; `eval.py` measures agreement with the teacher on
fresh situations. It builds on a clone of
[karpathy/llama2.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c) in
`model/llama2.c/`.

Step-by-step commands: [docs/pipeline.md](docs/pipeline.md). Two things the
project learned the hard way, both documented there and in
[docs/stats.md](docs/stats.md): the teacher prompt is the DNA of the whole
dataset (one sentence moved a goal from 45% of labels to 14%), and a
seven-minute prompt check before an overnight run is always worth it.

## Layout

- `common/` — everything shared verbatim by sim and firmware: `tank.c`
  (reflex layer, the snail), `render.c` (RGB565 software renderer, stats
  card, milestones page, the shop, the reset prompt and its pixel font),
  `progression.c` (the long game, the sand dollars and persistence),
  `icons.c` (baked pixel art), `audio.c` (the sound mixer), `notice.c` (the
  milestone and low-battery announcements), `update.c` (the update pages
  and their flow), `llm/` (4-bit engine, word
  tokenizer, the shared encoder)
- `sim/` — the LVGL + SDL2 simulator, its persistence port, and the self-tests
- `firmware/` — ESP-IDF app: display, touch, battery, IMU, RTC and audio
  ports for the three Waveshare boards and the Freenove FNK0104S (four boards), the on-device advisor scheduler,
  update mode and its Wi-Fi port, the QEMU harness, and the partition table
- `model/` — the frozen [state/goal schema](model/schema.md), trace
  generation, training, evaluation, probes, and the 4-bit export
- `installer/` — the browser installer page and the vendored ESP Web Tools
  bundle; `tools/make_installer.py` assembles the upload folder
- `tools/` — the icon baker, the sound bank builder, the installer
  assembler, the release manifest maker, the touch calibration fitter, the
  three-board picture sheet, and a serial bench client
- `assets/icons/` — the pixel-art source for the stats card, the badges,
  the shop and the snail
- `assets/sounds/` — the cues (16 kHz mono) and their levels

## Status

- ✅ Model: schema v4 (boredom, no shadow), 14.3M student, 4-bit export, evaluated
- ✅ Simulator: the full tank with progression, self-tests, snapshots
- ✅ Firmware: running on the real board at 25 to 30 fps and 3.7 s per
  decision, with touch, auto-rotation, a battery gauge and log (tap the
  battery for its page; on the cable it wears a bolt), and one
  key for sleep and wake (a 20 min nap window, then the board powers itself
  off to tens of microamps; from there a held press wakes it)
- ✅ The living tank: growth, arrivals with courtship, trust, the hunger
  economy, upkeep chores, milestones, the reset prompt, the first-run setup
  (place the bubbles, a letter wheel to name each fry, a body color to pick),
  births announced and named with a family page, a sleep that lives
  through the night at the next boot, fish that get bored and go exploring
- ✅ Sound: the board's own little speaker plays cues for what you do (a
  feed, the light, a trim, a card) and for the fish (eating, a spook, a
  fish coming to your finger), plus a welcome, a birth fanfare and
  milestone chimes with an on-screen announcement; the codec is only
  powered while the tank is in your hands, and a low-battery notice keeps
  the gauge on screen until it is charged; a settings page (from the
  milestones page) for brightness and volume, with a mute
- ✅ The light follows the hand: an optional idle rule (the motion sensor
  and touch) puts a tank left on the desk to sleep; the double-tap by
  default
- ✅ Sand dollars: care earns points, the shop spends them; a sword plant,
  an algae-grazing snail and a swim-through castle to start; what you buy you place yourself,
  where along the floor and whether it stands behind, among or in front
  of the fish
- ✅ Browser installer: one click from Chrome or Edge, at
  pocketank.com/install, with a board to pick; a cable update is the same click
  and never erases a tank
- ✅ v0.2.0 (alpha), the first numbered release: fish that turn like fish,
  the fish's name on its card, a shrimp school that eats what falls and
  multiplies, and a fry's welcome that comes before its badges
- ✅ v0.3 (alpha): two more boards (the round pendant and the watch),
  updates over Wi-Fi with signed, per-board images, a sea urchin that keeps
  the grass down, a snail that cleans overnight, a sponge and scissors, and
  fish you can rename or sell
- 🚧 Next: more to unlock: new fish species, more plants, corals, and more
  tank maintenance critters
- 🚧 Next: more achievements and milestones

## The video series

This repo is the companion to a YouTube series documenting the build:
distilling the model, designing the schema, squeezing inference into PSRAM,
first boot on real glass, and the tank growing into a pet.
